## Git CLI command line application



## Set up

Clone and cd into the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thatguuyG/npm_cli.git && cd npm-cli

```

Install dependecies:

```bash
npm i
```

If you'd like to install the tool globally on your machine, do

```bash
npm i -g
```

To uninstall the global cli tool:

```bash
npm uninstall -g cli
```

In this case, cli is the name field under package.json
